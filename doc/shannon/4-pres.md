# TSM-4: Total Computing with Pres: The Future of Safe, Expressive Software

For decades, the pursuit of Turing-complete computing has been the bedrock of modern programming. While it has empowered developers to build complex, general-purpose systems, it has also led to a world where bugs, crashes, and unpredictable behavior are accepted as inevitable. We've been told these issues are the price we pay for the expressiveness and flexibility of Turing completeness—a trade-off necessitated by the halting problem. But what if this trade-off wasn’t necessary? What if we could build powerful, expressive software that’s also inherently safe and predictable?

Enter **Pres**, a new programming language that challenges the notion that computing must be incomplete. By embracing total functions and building on the insights of **Presburger arithmetic**, Pres offers a radically different approach to software development. It’s designed to provide the reliability and safety of totality without sacrificing the expressiveness needed for modern, complex applications.

## **Presburger’s Insight: Incompleteness is a Choice**

In the 1930s, mathematician Mojżesz Presburger introduced a revolutionary concept: **Presburger arithmetic**. Unlike Peano arithmetic, which is the foundation for general Turing machines, Presburger arithmetic is decidable. This means that every valid statement in Presburger arithmetic can be resolved—there is no halting problem to worry about. The trade-off? Presburger arithmetic doesn’t support multiplication or division in the same unrestricted way as Peano arithmetic. Yet, it remains computationally powerful for a wide range of applications.

Fast forward to today, and this insight remains underappreciated. Presburger’s work showed us that computational incompleteness—the idea that some problems can’t be solved algorithmically—is not a necessity but a choice. Specifically, it’s a choice driven by the need to support complex operations like long division, which no modern computer actually performs in the same way. 

## **Pres: Computing Doesn’t Need to be Incomplete**

Pres is built on the radical claim that **computing doesn’t need to be incomplete**. By carefully designing a language around total functions and eliminating the need for Turing completeness, Pres delivers the benefits of safe, predictable software without sacrificing performance or expressiveness.

Here’s how Pres achieves this:

- **Total Functions as the Foundation:** Every function in Pres is guaranteed to terminate, ensuring that your programs won’t get stuck in infinite loops or unexpected states. This isn’t just about safety—it’s about reliability, security, and performance. By embracing total functions, Pres sidesteps the pitfalls of Turing completeness, offering a new paradigm where every computation can be trusted to complete.

- **Expressiveness Without Compromise:** Critics often argue that total languages are too restrictive, forcing developers to sacrifice expressiveness for safety. Pres turns this notion on its head. Through innovative language design, including homoiconic type expressions and asynchronous, event-driven architectures, Pres provides the flexibility and power needed to handle real-world applications, from complex simulations to distributed systems, without falling into the traps of non-termination.

- **Asynchronous, Event-Driven Architectures:** At the heart of Pres is an asynchronous, event-driven model. In this architecture, components of a system communicate by sending and receiving events, each processed in a finite and terminating manner. This approach not only ensures totality but also enables dynamic, adaptive systems that can respond to real-time inputs without risking system stability.

## **The Power of Dependent Types**

To achieve both safety and expressiveness, Pres leverages **dependent types**—a powerful concept that allows types to depend on values. Dependent types let you encode rich invariants and constraints directly into the type system. For example, you can define a vector type that includes its length as part of its type, ensuring that operations on the vector respect its size. This level of precision reduces runtime errors and makes your code more robust.

However, dependent types are often seen as difficult to work with, especially in languages that require complex proofs or verbose type annotations. This complexity can create a steep learning curve and slow down development. Pres addresses these challenges by integrating **homoiconic type expressions**—treating types as first-class citizens that can be manipulated just like any other data. This approach simplifies the use of dependent types, making them more accessible without sacrificing their power.

### **Solving Developer Challenges with Pres**

**1. Simplified Dependent Types:** Pres makes dependent types more approachable by allowing developers to define types through intuitive, first-class expressions. This reduces the verbosity and complexity typically associated with dependent types, enabling developers to write more precise and reliable code without the usual overhead.

**2. Handling Continuous and Adaptive Systems:** Continuous processes and adaptive systems are traditionally hard to model in total languages due to their need for potentially infinite loops or recursive functions. Pres addresses this by structuring these processes as sequences of discrete, finite events, ensuring that every computation terminates while still allowing for dynamic, responsive behavior.

**3. Modular, Scalable Development:** By breaking applications into independent, event-driven components, Pres facilitates modular development. Each component can be developed, tested, and reasoned about in isolation, and the asynchronous architecture ensures that the system scales efficiently.

### **The Future of Safe Software**

Pres is more than just a programming language—it’s a new approach to software development that combines the best of both worlds: the safety and reliability of total functions and the expressiveness and flexibility of modern programming languages. By integrating dependent types and embracing an event-driven model, Pres empowers developers to build the next generation of safe, scalable, and adaptable software systems.

Whether you're working on real-time systems, distributed applications, or complex simulations, Pres provides the tools you need to innovate without sacrificing safety. It’s time to leave behind the limitations of Turing completeness and embrace a future where every line of code is both powerful and trustworthy.
