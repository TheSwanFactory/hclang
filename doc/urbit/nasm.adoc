= nasm: The Nock Assembler
Draft 1, 2023-08-01 ~ponnum-minnus <ernest.prabhakar@gmail.com>

== Introduction

`nasm` is an high-level assembly language for nock bytecode,
the foundational computing layer of the Urbit decentralized network.

It defines symbols, conventions, tools and libraries that make it easy
for Earthlings to read and write nock.

This document (and most of the examples) are directly inspired by
https://blog.timlucmiptev.space/part1.html[Nock for Everyday Coders].
Any errors or misinterpretaions are, of course, my sole responsibility.

=== Example

```hclang
; .nock <- `nock`;
; nock.assemble { [50, 51] (get 2) }
# [[50, 51], [0, 2]]
; nock.print .-1
# `[50 51] [0 2]`
; nock.eval .-2
# 50
 
```

=== Homoiconic C

`nasm` is written in Homoiconic C (also known as "hclang"),
another minimalist axiomatic language.
It has suprisingly similar semantics to nock,
but is designed to maximize readability and simplify evaluation.
Homoiconic C has no keywords, but instead uses very precise syntax:

- `;` for end of expressions (and the input prompt)
- `#` for comments (and the output prompt)
- `[square brackets]` for comma-seperated lists ("boxed" grouping)
- `(round brackets)` for expressions ("unboxed" grouping)
- `{curly brackets}` for closures ("lazy" evaluation)
- `.name value` to assign (immutable) variables
- `<-` to load modules
- `backticks` ("`") for strings

=== Compiling to Assembly

While hclang is an impure systems language
(inspired by https://github.com/repos-bitc/bitc[bitc-lang]),
it includes a pure subset that can be compiled to Nock assembly:

```hclang
; [50, 51].0
# 50
; nock.compile { [50, 51] .0 }
# { [50, 51] (get 2) }
```

=== Shortcuts

For brevity, we use the following abbreviations:

```hclang
; .nasm nock.assemble;
; .nc nock.compile;
; .eval nock.eval;
; .run { eval (nasm _) }
; .pp { nock.print (nasm _) } # pretty-print assembly
```

Where `_` is the default argument for a closure

This allows us to rewrite the initial example as:

```hclang
; run { [50, 51] (get 2) }
# 50
```

== A. Primitive Operators

```hclang
.get 0 # '/'
.is-cell 3 # '?'
.increment 4 # '+'
.is-equal 5 # '='
.set 100 # '#'
.eval 102 # '*'
```

The Nock [pseudocode notation](https://developers.urbit.org/reference/nock/definition#rules)
defines six prefix operators: ?, +, =, /, #, and *.

Nasm instantiates these as actual operators with actual names
(while I sympathize with the desire to avoid English cultural imperialism,
I find explicit words very helpful in the learning process).

Note that eval and set are assigned 1xx psuedo-opcodes, as are other non-coded operations.
These simplify composition, but are "compiled away" by the assembler.
See Appendix A for more details.


=== Examples

```hclang
; run { 50 (get 1) }
# 50
; run { [50, 51] (get 2) }
# 50
; run { 50 (is-cell (get 1)) }
# 1 (false)
; run { [50] (is-cell (get 1)) }
# 0 (true)
; run { 50 (increment (get 1)) }
# 51
; run { [50, 51] (is-equal (get 2) (get 2)) }
# 0 (true)
; run { [50, 51] (is-equal (get 2) (get 3)) }
# 1 (false)
; run { 50 (set (2 (get 1)) [8, 9, 10]) }
# [50, 9, 10]
; run { eval (50 (get 1))}
# 50
; run { .ANY (set (2 {50}) [8, 9, 10]) }
# [50, 9, 10] (explicit set)
```

=== Hierarchical `get`

The `get` opcode in nock extracts items from a binary tree
(which is what all lists are implemented as in nock)

```hclang
; run { list (get 2) }
# 10
; run { list (get 5) }
# [12, 13]
```

For convenience, you can pass `get` a 0-based list of nested indices
(rather than a number) which it will use to calculate the appropriate offset:

```hclang
; .list2 [20, 21, [22, 23]];
; list2 .0
# 20
; list2 .2 .1
# 23
; nc {list2 .2 .1}
# { [20, [21, [22, 23]]] (get [1, 1, 1]) } # 8, I think
; eval .-1
# 23
```

== B. Quoting and Evaluation

=== OpCode 1: quote

The `quote` opcode ignores the subject and returns its body:

```hclang
; nasm { [50, 51] (quote get 2) }
# [[50, 51], [1, [0, 2]]]
; eval .-1
# [0, 2]
```

Note that the assembler stil expands variable names inside a quote,
such as `get`.

You can get the same effect by passing an hclang closure:

```hclang
; nasm { [50, 51] {get 2} }
# [[50, 51], [1, [0, 2]]]
```

Observe that the eval pseudo-app acts as the inverse of quote,
and may be expanded by the assembler:

```hclang
; nasm { [50, 51] (eval {get 2}) }
# [[50, 51], [0, 2]]
```

=== OpCode 7: compose

The simplest native evaluation opcode is `compose`,
which repeatedly applies its arguments to the subject:

```hclang
; nasm { [23, 45] (compose (get 3) (incr (get 1))) }
# { [23, 45], [7, [0, 3], [4, 0, 1]] }
; eval .-1
# 46
```

Because hclang supports linear lists as well as binary expressions,
you can also just specify a sequence of operations directly,
and nasm will interpolate the 7.

```hclang
; nasm { [23, 45] (get 3) (incr (get 1)) }
# { [23, 45], [7, [0, 3], [4, 0, 1]] }
; eval .-1
# 46
```

Note that this means that if you want to invoke The Distribution Rule (below)
you must explicitly group the formulas as a cell:

```hclang
; nasm { [23, 45] [(get 3), (incr (get 2))] }
# { [23, 45], [[0, 3], [4, 0, 2]] }
; eval .-1
# [45, 24]
```

=== OpCode 2: map-eval

OpCode 2 is the more general version of 7
(more precisely, 7 is syntactic sugar on 2).
It evaluates *both* arguments against the subject
before applying them.

```hclang
; [(incr (get 1)), 51] [map-eval (get 3) (get 2)]
# [[[4, 0, 1], 51], [2, [0, 3] [0, 2]]]
; eval .-1
# 52
# Original: { [[4, 0, 1], 51] [2, [0, 3] [0, 2]] }
# Effect: { 51 (incr (get 1)) }
```

== C. Methods

The "method" operation `[a 9 b c]` does two things:

- applies formula `c` to the subject
- invokes the method at slot `b` against that new subject

For example, if `a` is an atom and `b` is 2,
then it simply applies the new formula `c` to `a`.

It is also defined as syntactic sugar on top of `map-eval`:

```hclang
# *[a 9 b c]
; {a (method b c)}
#  -> *[*[a c] 2 [0 1] 0 b]
; { (a c) (map-eval (get 1) (get b))}
; { (a c) ((a c) (get b))}
```

Note that if `c` is a "compound formula" (cell), then by "The Distribution Rule"
the result of applying c to a will be the map of all components.

```hclang
# { a [c1, c2] } ->
# { [a c1, a c2]}
```

As we can see using the following bindings:

```hclang
; .a 45;
; .b 2;
; .c { {incr (get 3)}, (get 1) };
; .c1 { {incr (get 3)} };
; .c2 { get 1 };
```

which gives:

```hclang
# Original: .*(45 [9 2 [1 4 0 3] 0 1])
; nasm { 45 (method 2 [{incr (get 3)}, (get 1)]) }
# [45, [9, [2, [[1, [4, [0, 3]], [0, 1]]]]]]
; eval .-1
# 46
```

using the following expansion:

```hclang
# (a [c1 c2]) ->
# [45 {incr (get 3)}, 45 (get 1)] ->
# [incr (get 3), 45]

# { 45 (method 2 [{incr (get 3)}, (get 1)]) } ->
# { [incr (get 3), 45] ([incr (get 3), 45] (get 2)) } ->
# { [incr (get 3), 45] (incr (get 3)) } ->
# { incr 45 }
# 46
```


== D. Conditionals

Opcode 6 emulates a traditional if-else:

```hclang
# Original: *(1 [6 [0 1] [0 1] [4 0 1]])
; nasm { 1 [6 (get 1) (get 1) (incr (get 1))] }
# [1, [6, [0, 1], [0, 1], [4, [0, 1]]]]
; eval .-1
# 2
# `1 (get 1)` is 1 (false), so it calls the second branch (increment)
```

nasm allows you to instead use the hclang primitives '?' and ':' for
if and else, respectively, much like the C ternary operator:

```hclang
; nasm { 1 ((get 1) ? (get 1) : (incr (get 1))) }
# [1, [6, [0, 1], [0, 1], [4, [0, 1]]]]
```

Note that however these are actually two binary operators:

- "?" returns its argument if the subject is true (0), else returns false (1)
- ":" returns its argument if the subject is false (1), else returns true (0)

Each of these has its own pseudo-code:

```hclang
# Other OpCodes
.if-else 6
.if-true 161
.else 162
```

Which can be useful when compling hclang:

```hclang
; nc { [50, 51] (<> ? .0 : .1) }
# { [50, 51] (0 (if-true get 2) (else get 3)) }
```

== E. Prepend

OpCode 8 is used to prepend a value to a subject and then runs the second formula:

Either by getting an existing value:

```hclang
# Original: ([67 39] [8 [0 3] [4 0 2]])
; nasm { [67, 39] (prepend (get 3) (incr get 2)) }
# [[67, 39], [8, [0, 3], [4, 0, 2]]]
; eval .-1
# 40 (incr 39)
```

Or creating a new one:

```hclang
# Original: ([67 39] [8 [1 0] [4 0 2]])
; nasm { [67, 39] (prepend {0} (incr get 2)) }
# [[67, 39], [8, [1, 0], [4, 0, 2]]]
; eval .-1
# 1 (incr 0)
```

This makes it easy to store "local variables" that can be used
without modifying the rest of the payload.


== F. Native


OpCode 11 is a general 'escape hatch' to call native functionality.

For example, passing an atom calls the procedure with that syscall index
using the rest of the argument as the body:

```hclang
# Original: ([50 51] [11 103 0 2])
; .nasm.sycall.103 { nock.print _ }
; .atom-print 103;
; run { [50, 51] (native atom-print (get 2)) }
`[50, 51] (get 2)` # print expression
# 50
```

Conversely, passing a cell executes the nock expression first:


```hclang
; run { [50, 51] (native [atom-print {}] (get 2)) }
`50` # print result
# 50
```

== G. Compile-Time Variables

The assembler has access to local context, so it can access and expand variables.

```hclang
; .list [10, 11, 12, 13];
; nasm { list }
# [10, [11, [12, 13]]]
```

The local context itself is represented by '.',
which nasm models as an implicit get:

```hclang
; nasm { . }
# {0 1}
```

By default, the compiler will expand local variables:

```hclang
; nc { list.0 }
# { [10, [11, [12, 13]]] (get 2) }
```

We can instead tell the compiler to include an environment
as part of its output.
That tells it to not expand those variables,
but instead pass along  for the assembler to use.


```hclang
; nc.pass { list }
; nc { list.0  }
# {.. <- .list; list [get 2] }
; run .-1
# 10
```

The `..` operator adds those names to the parent context,
so nasm knows it can make use of it.


== Appendix A: RINC Pseudo-Ops

Strictly speaking, nasm is actually designed around the small number
of primitive operations that are used to define nock,
rather than the actual nock opcodes.
This also makes it easy to compile hclang primitives down to the
corresponding psuedo-op.

This approach is similar to the way modern processors and compilers
tend to use orthogonal Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) operations,
rather the Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) operations
optimized for efficient hand-coding.
Hence the term "RINC", for Reduced Instruction Nock Computing.

The nasm assembler is repsonsible for converting any pseudo-ops
into the appropriate nock opcodes, so the resulting code runs
on any nock-compatible virtual machine.

```hclang
.opcodes [

    # Primitive Operators

    .is-cell 3 # '?'
    .increment 4 # '+'
    .is-equal 5 # '='
    .get 0 # '/'
    .set 10 # '#'
    .eval 100 # '*'

    # Other OpCodes

    .quote 1
    .map-eval 2
    .if-else 6
    .compose 7
    .prepend 8
    .call 9
    .hint 11

    # Other Pseudo-Operators

    .map 121
    .reduce 122
    .if 161
    .else 162
    .insert 181
    .delete 182
]
```
