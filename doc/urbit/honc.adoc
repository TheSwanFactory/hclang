= Hoon is from Mars, Honc is from Venus
== Homoiconic-On-Nock-C: An Easy-to-Love Scripting Language for Urbit

** INCOMPLETE **

Draft 0, 2023-08-01 ~ponnum-minnus <ernest.prabhakar@gmail.com>


* Hoon is a warrior, carving bloody runes into the harsh Martian cliffs in order to un-think the corrupted idioms of Earth.

* Honc is a lover, singing soft songs of the gentle Venetian seas to woo wayward sailors back to their native innocence.

More prosaically, Honc is an attempt to express Nock semantics in the familiar, C-like syntax (and terminology) used by Python, Ruby, etc.  
It is built on Homoiconic C ("hclang"), another attempt to reinvent programming on an axiomatic, tree-structured foundation.

Initially, I thought it might be easy to implement nock in hclang, to give Urbit developers a more approachable scripting language.
As I got into it, however, I began to wonder whether it was the other way around, and I should be re-implemeting hclang on top of nock!

In other words, is it possible hclang and nock are both manifestations of the same "ur" programming language?

Honc is my attempt to answer that question.

Note: this document is inspired by, and largely replicates, the excellent https://blog.timlucmiptev.space/part1.html[Nock tutorial] by ~timluc-miptev.
Any errors are mine alone; corrections are deeply appreciated!

## The `nockc` compiler

`nockc` is a hclang function that compiles a pure subset of hclang to equivalent nock structures.

```hclang
; . <- `nock`; # import nock module [does not yet exist] into current context

; nockc <> # all or true in hclang
# 0
; nockc () # nil or false in hclang
# 1
```

All hclang functions take a single argument, which can be `nil` or a complex data structure.

Note this fragment uses the hclang input (";") and output ("#") prompts from the REPL.  
Since ";" terminates expressions, and "#" creates comments,
REPL code can be pasted directly into a source file (where it is interprted as a doctest).

## nock Cells as hclang Groups

Similar to nouns in nock, every value in hclang is a "frame."
Syntatically, frames can be single literals ("atoms") or grouped collections ("cells").

### [list]

The simplest way way to represent cells in hclang is as a "boxed" group,
which is a comma-seperated list with square brackets:

```hclang
; nockc [782, [0b11, 0xFACE]]
# [782, [3, 64206]]
```

### (expression)
Frame expressions are grouped using round brackets (parenthesis),
which are "unboxed."
That is, single values (as in nock) are returned as scalars rather than groups.

```hclang
; (1)
# 1
; (1, 2)
# [1, 2]
```

### {function}

Frame uses curly braces for lazy evaluation (i.e., "functions").
For example, list by default appends its argument:

```hclang
; [1]
# [1]
; (1] 2
# [1, 2]
; ((1] 2)
# [1, 2]
```

However, wrapping that expression in curly braces defers evaluation:

```hclang
; {(1] 2}
# {(1] 2}
```

This will be more obviously useful when we bind frames to names, below.

## Properties

Frames are monadic, in that they can act as dictionaries, enumerables, or functions.
Individuals frames are treated as continuous lists rather than binary trees,
though the underlying implementation can be optimized for efficiency.

There are two ways to access elements of a Frame:

### Indexed Values: OpCode 0

Frame indices are 0-based, as in C.
The compiler will [need to] be smart enough to translate between frames and cells,
including any implicit or explicit nesting.

```hclang
; [1, 2, 3].1
# 2

; nockc {[1, 2, 3].1}
# ([1, 2, 3], [0, 4])

; nockc [1, [2, 3]].1.0
# ([1, [2, 3]], [0, 4])
```

### Named Values: Compile-Time Variables

Names in frame use a "." sigil, to distingiush from the value.
Values are thus assigned directly to a name without any "=",
in a syntax reminiscent of CSS.

In particular we can set `.name value` in the current or an explicit frame,
then retrieve it at compile time:

```hclang
; .pi 3.14;
; nockc pi
# 3.14
; nockc {pi}
# {3.14}

; .plist [.a 1, pi, a, 0o212];
; nockc plist
# [1, 3.14, 1, 42]

; plist.a
# 1
; nockc {plist .a}
# same as "plist.0" 
# [[1, 3.14, 1, 42], [0, 2]]
```

## The `nock` interpreter

In addition to the `nockc` compiler,
honc includes a `nock` interpteter that can evaluate the results:

```hclang
; .nlist (nockc {plist .a});
; nlist
# {[1, 3.14, 1, 42] [0, 2]}
; nock nlist
# 1
````

Note that by default groupings simply append,
so if you evaluate a result directly you just get a longer frame:

```hclang
; nlist()
# [1, 3.14, 1, 42, [0, 2]]
````

### nock Quote as Lazy Groupings: OpCode 1

Frame uses curly braces for deferred evaluation (i.e., "functions").

By default, non-final expressions will be returned as lazy:

```hclang
; nockc([1, 2, 3], [0, 3])
# {[1, 2, 3] [0, 3]}
````




```hclang
````


```hclang
````

## Honc Class

The Honc class (which in hclang is just a function with properties) implements most of honc.
Instances of the Honc class acts as the subject for all honc expressions.

You can directly evaluate Nock expressions by calling Honc:

```hclang
; Honc([50, 51],[0, 2])()
# 50
```

However, the following sections show the built-in convenience functions
that allow you to write more traditional code.

## Convenience Methods

Much of the time, nock functions are implemented as methods on the Honc class:

```hclang
.HoncMapping {
    .echo 0
    .unbox 1
    .mutate 2
    .incr 4
    .cell? 3
    .equal? 5
    .if_else 6
    .compose 7
    .add_var 8
    .exec 9
    .replace 10

    _ & {^ __} # The Distribution Rule
}
```
To get the raw opcodes, pass the expression to `nock` instead of evaluating it:

```hclang
; nock { Honc([50, 51]).echo(2) }
# [[50, 51], [0, 2]]
```

Note that hclang uses curly braces to defer evaluation.


### OpCode 0: Echo

For example, the 0 operator becomes the `echo` method on Honc:

```hclang
; Honc(42).echo() # defaults to 1
# 42
; Honc([50, 51]).echo(2)
# 50
```

As a convenience, you can pass `echo` a list of 0-based indices for nested data structures:

```hclang
; .apples Honc([[`apple`, .pie] [0b1101, 0xdad]]);
; apples.echo(5)
# .pie 
; apples.echo([0, 1])
# .pie
```

Note that hclang expresses variable assignment via symbol expressions (`.key value`).


### OpCode 1: Unbox

Honc considers opcode 1 as "unbox" rather than "quote", because it removes brackets wherever possible.

```hclang
; Honc([.anything]).unbox(67)
# 67
; Honc().unbox([67])
# 67
; Honc().unbox([6, [7, [8, [9]]])
# [6, 7, 8, 9]
```

### OpCode 2: Mutate


```hclang
# Original: [50 51] [2 [0 3] [1 [4 0 1]]]
; .op2a { Honc([50, 51]).exec {echo(3), unbox(incr().echo())} }
; nock op2a
# ([50, 51], [2, [0, 3], [1, [4, 0, 1]]])
; op2a()
# 52

# Original: [[4 0 1] 51] [2 [0 3] [0 2]]]
; .op2b { Honc([4, 0, 1]) }

```

### OpCode 3: Type Cell

```hclang

```


### OpCode 4: Incremement

```hclang
# Original: [50 [4 0 1]]
; Honc(50).echo().incr()
# 51
; nock { Honc(50).echo().incr() }
# [50, [4, 0, 1]]

# Original: [50 [4 4 0 1]]
; .op4 { Honc(50).echo().incr(2) };
; .op4()
# 52
; nock op4
# [50, [4, 4, 0, 1]]
```

== H. Map and Reduce in hclang

The easiest way for me to understand nock opcode 2 is in terms of
two hclang primitive operators: map `&` and reduce `|`.
These map to pseudo-operators in nasm:

```hclang
.map 121
.reduce 122
```
=== Map

Map creates a new list from an old list by applying a closure in parallel:

```hclang
; [1, 2] & {pp _} 
# [`1`, `2`]
```

=== Reduce

Reduce creates a single element from an old list by repeated application to a seed.
For example, when you apply an element to a list it appends (repeatedly):

```hclang
; [] 1
# [1]
; [1] 2
# [1, 2]
; [1, 2] 3 4
# [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

We can use this (rather awkwardly) to clone a list using Reduce:

```hclang
; [1, 2, 3, 4] | []
# [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Compared to wrapping each element if we instead used Map:


```hclang
; [1, 2, 3, 4] & []
# [[1], [2], [3], [4]]
```

=== Evaluation

Importantly, Reduce is how hclang performs evaluation.

Consider `nock.print` of a cell:

```hclang
; nock.print [1, 2]
# `[1 2]`
```

We can implement it as either a closure to apply:


```hclang
; .np_closure { nock.print [1, 2] };
; np_closure()
# `[1 2]`
```

or a list of elements to apply:


```hclang
; .np_list [ nock, .print, [1, 2] ];
; np_list | ()
# `[1 2]`
```

=== Applications of nil

Note that applying any element to nil results in that element:

```hclang
; () 1
# 1
```

Applying nil a to non-closure just returns that element:

```hclang
; 1 ()
# 1
```


Applying nil to a closure evaluates it:


```hclang
; { 1 } ()
# 1
```

=== map-eval in hclang


```hclang
; .op2 { [50, 51] [2, [0, 3], [1, [4, 0, 1]]] }
; .op2a { [50, 51] [map-eval (get 3) {incr get 1}] }

# Break it down into map:
; { (get 3), {incr get 1} } & [50, 51] 
# { 51 (incr get 1) }

# Then eval:
; pp { 51 (incr get 1) }
# `52`
```

To simplify compilation into this opcode, nock defines a new '&|' operator:

```hclang
; [1, 2] nock.&| []
# [1, [2]]
# From: [[1], [2]] | ()

; nc { [(get 3), {incr get 1} ] &| [50, 51] }
# { [50, 51] [map-eval (get 3) {incr get 1}] }
```
