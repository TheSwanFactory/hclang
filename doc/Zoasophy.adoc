= Zoasophy: Ent Club
Draft 0.1, 2021-10-13

Trying to define Zoaphosy using English words is proving too confusing.
Therefore, I am going to define what I mean using a formal language.
This is ultimately intended to be machine-computable, but hopefully it will help clarify my point even for human readers.

== Ent Entities

To make this simple, we will use an abstract entity I call an *Ent*.
Ent is also a wonderful term from Tolkien for creatures who are wise but slow moving.
I define Ents in terms of three attributes:
- Perspective:: determines their Preferences in any given Context
- Energy:: used to perform actions. Ent's try to conserve this
- Generativity:: a tuple of (Individuating, Connecting). Ent's try to maximize this.
```
.Ent <Perspective, Energy, Generativity>
```
