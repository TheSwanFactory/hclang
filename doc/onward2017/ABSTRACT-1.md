# Onward 2017! Abstract

## Take 1

Homoiconic C attempts to define the minimal set of abstractions necessary to
support our most powerful programming idioms (i.e., Lisp, C, shell) as well as
common data formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, HTML). The key is a novel data structure
we call a Frame, which combines aspects of a function, dictionary, and array.

Though seemingly complex, we will demonstrate how Frames provide a much simpler
way of thinking about and accessing traditional formats and protocols. In
addition, Frames can represent C-like machine-oriented imperative code even more
elegantly than Lisp does abstract functional code. Finally, we introduce a small
set of operators, data protection rules, and syntax that we hypothesize is
sufficient to represent any real-world computation.
