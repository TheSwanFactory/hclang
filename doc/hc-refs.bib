abstract = {
Despite the long list of publications on parser combinators, there does
not yet exist a monadic parser combinator library that is applicable in
real world situations. In particular naive implementations of parser
combinators are likely to suffer from space leaks and are often unable to
report precise error messages in case of parse errors. The Parsec parser
combinator library described in this paper, utilizes a novel
implementation technique for space and time efficient parser combinators
that in case of a parse error, report both the position of the error as
well as all grammar productions that would have been legal at that point
in the input.
