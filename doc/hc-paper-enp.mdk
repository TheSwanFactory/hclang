[TITLE]

~ Abstract
There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West.
Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued
food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.

Our contributions are:

* A figure of a _butterfly_;
* Some **mathematics**;
* And some source code;
* And references to Tex books [@Knuth:TeX;@Lamport:LaTeX;@Goo93;@Fberg04] and others [@Grandstrand]. 
  Textual citations, like @Knuth:TeX are also possible.

# Content

A definition of $e$ is shown in Equation [#euler] proved by Theorem [#th-euler]:

~ Equation { #euler }
e = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n
~

~ Theorem {#th-euler; caption:"Euler's theorem" }
More math here.
~

Let's program some Javascript:
``` javascript
function hello() {
  return "hello world!"
}
```

~ Note
The syntax highlighting works in the PDF output too.

# Conclusion

Really fun to write Markdown :-)
