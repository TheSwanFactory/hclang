## Introduction

MAML is the [*Multipurpose Abstract Markup Language*](https://theswanfactory.com/2016/11/08/introducing-maml-a-draft-proposal-for-html6/).  It is a radically simple proposal for replacing all the existing web technologies with a single, universal language for code and data we call [Homoiconic C](https://theswanfactory.com/2016/12/20/homoiconic-c-a-universal-language-for-code-and-data/).
